<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

    git clone https://github.com/imgjeits/genre-checker.git
    ```
3. Install dev dependencies by running either either `npm install` or `yarn install` in the terminal

### Setup

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

The site is pretty straightforward. You search for an artist name, and the site displays up to 20 of the more popular artists from the Spotify API. You can then click on the name or picture of one of these artists, and the site will display the artist along with their genres from Spotify. You can also then click the artist name, which will take you to the artist page on Spotify (web or app, depending on your own settings).
